# ðŸŽ¯ Sales Performance Analysis & Strategic Recommendations for Product Optimization

## Requirements
- Big Query
- Looker Studio

## Identify the primary key
A primary key is a unique attribute in a database table that is used to exclusively identify each row. Each primary key value must be unique and must not be empty (null).
- Primary key table Customer : CustomerID
- Primary key table Products: ProdNumber 
- Primary key table Orders : OrderID
- Primary key table ProductCategory : CategoryID

```sql
# TASK 1: DESCRIBE THE PRIMARY KEY
# Customers Table
SELECT CustomerID, COUNT(*) AS jumlah
FROM `sales_dataset.Customers`
GROUP BY CustomerID
HAVING COUNT(*) > 1;

SELECT COUNT(*) AS null_count
FROM `sales_dataset.Customers`
WHERE CustomerID IS NULL;

#Orders Table
SELECT OrderID, COUNT(*) AS jumlah
FROM `sales_dataset.Orders`
GROUP BY OrderID
HAVING COUNT(*) > 1;

SELECT COUNT(*) AS null_count
FROM `sales_dataset.Orders`
WHERE OrderID IS NULL;

#Products Table
SELECT ProdNumber, COUNT(*) AS jumlah
FROM `sales_dataset.Products`
GROUP BY ProdNumber
HAVING COUNT(*) > 1;

SELECT COUNT(*) AS null_count
FROM `sales_dataset.Products`
WHERE ProdNumber IS NULL;

# ProductCategory Table
SELECT CategoryID, COUNT(*) AS jumlah
FROM `sales_dataset.ProductCategory`
GROUP BY CategoryID
HAVING COUNT(*) > 1;

SELECT COUNT(*) AS null_count
FROM `sales_dataset.ProductCategory`
WHERE CategoryID IS NULL;
```

## Relationship between tables
- Determine each primary key in the 4 datasets.
- Determine the relationship between the four tables.

```sql
#Verify the relationship between Customers and Orders (Foreign Key: CustomerID)
SELECT o.CustomerID
FROM `sales_dataset.Orders` o
LEFT JOIN `sales_dataset.Customers` c ON o.CustomerID = c.CustomerID
WHERE c.CustomerID IS NULL AND o.CustomerID IS NOT NULL;

# Verify the relationship between Orders and Products (Foreign Key: ProdNumber)
SELECT o.ProdNumber
FROM `sales_dataset.Orders` o
LEFT JOIN `sales_dataset.Products` p ON o.ProdNumber = p.ProdNumber
WHERE p.ProdNumber IS NULL AND o.ProdNumber IS NOT NULL;

# Verify the relationship between Products and ProductCategory (Foreign Key: Category)
SELECT p.Category
FROM `sales_dataset.Products` p
LEFT JOIN `sales_dataset.ProductCategory` pc ON p.Category = pc.CategoryID
WHERE pc.CategoryID IS NULL AND p.Category IS NOT NULL;

```
- Creating Relationship (Relationship Logic)
```sql
SELECT 
    c.CustomerID, c.FirstName, o.OrderID, o.Quantity, p.ProdName, pc.CategoryName
FROM `sales_dataset.Customers` c
JOIN `sales_dataset.Orders` o ON c.CustomerID = o.CustomerID
JOIN `sales_dataset.Products` p ON o.ProdNumber = p.ProdNumber
JOIN `sales_dataset.ProductCategory` pc ON p.Category = pc.CategoryID
LIMIT 10;

```


## Table Master
This MasterTable is created to make it easier to analyze in dashboards or business reports. This data can be used to calculate total sales, number of orders, and customer analysis by city or product category.

```sql
#TASK 3: CREATE A MASTER TABLE
CREATE TABLE `sales_dataset.MasterTable` AS
SELECT 
    o.Date AS order_date,
    pc.CategoryName AS category_name,
    p.ProdName AS product_name,
    p.Price AS product_price,
    o.Quantity AS order_qty,
    (o.Quantity * p.Price) AS total_sales,
    c.CustomerEmail AS cust_email,
    c.CustomerCity AS cust_city
FROM `sales_dataset.Orders` o
JOIN `sales_dataset.Customers` c ON o.CustomerID = c.CustomerID
JOIN `sales_dataset.Products` p ON o.ProdNumber = p.ProdNumber
JOIN `sales_dataset.ProductCategory` pc ON p.Category = pc.CategoryID
ORDER BY o.Date ASC;
```
